## About

#### This web based application is a self-scoring trivia game about car knowledge. The game asks 10 questions of general car facts and presents a final score. My previous career was in the automotive industry with a degree in engineering, so I chose cars as my project to support my personal correlation between the tech and automotive tech industries. Engineer. Build. Fix. Repeat.
